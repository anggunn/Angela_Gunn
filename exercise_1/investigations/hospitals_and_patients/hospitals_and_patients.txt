Hospitals and Patients

The Question: 
Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

(note - this isn't really a top-10 type question, so the answer is a bit longer).

We have two ways to rank hospitals: 
by procedure score and by survey score.

We already looked at ranking hospitals by procedure score, so let's focus on survey score.

The surveys have a two values, base score and consistency score. These values are added together to get
a patient experience score out of 100 points, where 100 is perfect scores.

I present here the 23 hospitals that received a perfect score (100/100).
(S_Rank = Survey Rank)

ID      S_Rank  Hospital Name
------	------	--------------------------------------
040152	1		PHYSICIANS' SPECIALTY HOSPITAL

390323	1		ADVANCED SURGICAL HOSPITAL

Since we only looked at hospitals with 45 or more measures when ranking hospitals (hospital_prime),
we should limit the survey responses to just those hospitals that are in that same set.

Here is the new top 10 for hospital survey rankings using just the hospitals in hospital_prime:
(S_Rank = Survey Rank,
Base = Base_Score, Consis = Consistency Score)

ID		S_Rank	Base	Consis	Hospital Name
------	------	------	----	--------------------------------------
370215	1		78		20		OKLAHOMA HEART HOSPITAL
450604	2		77		20		HILL COUNTRY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL INC
370234	3		74		20		OKLAHOMA HEART HOSPITAL SOUTH
180044	4		70		20		PIKEVILLE MEDICAL CENTER
200020	4		70		20		YORK HOSPITAL
410008	6		69		20		SOUTH COUNTY HOSPITAL INC
340115	7		68		20		FIRSTHEALTH MOORE REGIONAL HOSPITAL
340145	8		67		20		CAROLINAS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LINCOLN
140101	8		67		20		MORRIS HOSPITAL & HEALTHCARE CENTERS
110011	8		67		20		TANNER MEDICAL CENTER - CARROLLTON


Now, if we look at the 10 top hospitals we saw before, this is how they rank on the surveys:
(P_Rank = Procedure Rank, S_Rank = Survey Rank,
Base = Base_Score, Consis = Consistency Score)

ID		P_Rank	S_Rank	Base	Consis	Hospital Name
------	------	------	----	------	--------------------------------------
390138	1		540		30		18		WAYNESBORO HOSPITAL
050424	2		223		39		20		SCRIPPS GREEN HOSPITAL
170197	3		223		39		20		KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER LLC
420065	4		180		41		20		BON SECOURS-ST FRANCIS XAVIER HOSPITAL
450822	5		1225	14		18		LAS COLINAS MEDICAL CENTER
230072	6		348		34		20		HOLLAND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
100267	7		2000	0		15		ENGLEWOOD COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
100252	8		1265	14		17		RAULERSON HOSPITAL
450662	9		1561	11		14		VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
260006	10		318		35		20		HEARTLAND REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER


We can see none of the hospitals in our top 10 are given perfect scores
in the patient experience scores. In fact, the highest ranking survey score of this group is 180, 
and one has a survey rank of 2000 (out of 2179).

The Pearson's Correlation for the two ranks (procedure rank and survey rank) is 0.21
This means the two rankings are weakly correlated.
