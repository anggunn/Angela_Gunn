The Question: 
What states are models of high-quality care?


The below table shows my findings for the top 10 states:

State Mean	StDev
----- ------	------
WI    13.39	10.7
CO    14.22	10.03
UT    14.39	12.76
ME    17.09	13.51
SD    17.83	17.26
NH    18.17	14.15
IN    18.3	8.56
HI    19.39	12.16
FL    20.57	15.36
NE    21.09	15.67



It would be easy to say the state with the most "best hospitals" should be the best state, but
we need to consider each state has a different number of hospitals, partly driven by the 
state's population.

A state with 3 hospitals may all be top ranked, but a state with 10 hospitals 
may have 3 top ranked hospitals but 7 average or lower ranked hospitals.

A state typically imposes different policies on all of its hospitals, so regardless 
if a hospital has one or many measures, it in theory is following the policies established
by the state on that particular procedure. For this reason, instead of filtering out hospitals,
I filter out measures that are most frequently used. There are around 60 measures that are
actually used in the Procedures table. I select the 30 most frequently used measures, storing 
them in the view Measures_Prime.

The approach is to roll up all the measure scores from within-state hospitals 
and average them to make one measure score for the full state. To do this, I start the
same way I did for hospitals in that I find the rank of the measure scores across all scores 
for that measure. I then average the ranks for measures in the same state to get one row 
per state-measure combination, representing the average rank placement for that measure.

Then I re-rank everything to see the ranks between states. So now if I take my view, I can 
see how a particular state ranks compared to other states on the same measure (the value
here is between 1 and 51, with 1 being the best value).

I then calculate the mean and standard deviation for each state, and present the ten states
with the highest average rank.
