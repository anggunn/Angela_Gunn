Hospital Variability

The Question: 
Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

My results for top 10 measures with the greatest variability:

Measure	Var     StDev	Mean	Measure Name
-------	-------	-----	------	------------------------
ED_1b	8617.74	92.83	271.61	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients
ED_2b	3864.69	62.17	98.52	Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients
OP_18b	1656.55	40.7	142.77	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients
OP_3b	869.03	29.48	60.75	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate
STK_4	481.99	21.95	82.9	Thrombolytic Therapy
OP_23	477.19	21.84	66.71	Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 Minutes of ED Arrival
AMI_7a	352.67	18.78	50.0	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received within 30 Minutes of Hospital Arrival
OP_2	325.75	18.05	70.25	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival
OP_21	314.08	17.72	55.36	Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture
OP_20	285.0	16.88	28.08	Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients



For this, I just took the variance, standard deviation and mean of each of the measures,
and sorted on the variance. However, if you look at these variables, they are very different in how they are measured. 
Some are based on the amount of time, where others are based on a 100-pt scale.

So let's look at these two types of measures separately.

For those measures that are given a score based on time, we get the following top measures:
Measure	Var		StDev	Mean	Measure Name
-------	------	-----	------	------------------------
ED_1b	8617.74	92.83	271.61	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients
ED_2b	3864.69	62.17	98.52	Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients
OP_18b	1656.55	40.7	142.77	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients
OP_3b	869.03	29.48	60.75	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate
OP_21	314.08	17.72	55.36	Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture
OP_20	285.0	16.88	28.08	Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients
OP_1	57.21	7.56	26.0	Median Time to Fibrinolysis
OP_5	37.32	6.11	8.33	Median Time to ECG

There is large variability in the scores based on time, with the median time for arrival to departure 
having the greatest variance. 

And for those measures that are scored out of 100, these are the top 10 measures:

Measure	Var		StDev	Mean	Measure Name
-------	------	-----	------	------------------------
STK_4	481.99	21.95	82.9	Thrombolytic Therapy
OP_23	477.19	21.84	66.71	Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 Minutes of ED Arrival
AMI_7a	352.67	18.78	50.0	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received within 30 Minutes of Hospital Arrival
OP_2	325.75	18.05	70.25	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival
VTE_5	265.79	16.3	88.88	Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin Therapy Discharge Instructions
VTE_1	232.79	15.26	89.11	Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
STK_8	196.37	14.01	90.54	Stroke Education
CAC_3	161.78	12.72	89.38	Home Management Plan of Care (HMPC) Document Given to Patient/Caregiver
IMM_2	142.68	11.94	91.75	Influenza Immunization
HF_1	139.9	11.83	93.61	Discharge Instructions

We can see Thrombolytic Therapy is the measure here with the greatest variance, with a mean 
of 82.9 and a standard deviation of 21.95.
