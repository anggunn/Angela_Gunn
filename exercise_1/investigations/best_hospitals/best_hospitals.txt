The Question: 
What hospitals are models of high-quality careâ€”that is, 
which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures?


The below table shows my findings for the top 10 hospitals:

ID		Mean 	StdDev	Hospital Name												
------	------	------	---------------------------------------------------	
390138	174.76	317.37	WAYNESBORO HOSPITAL
050424	202.0	330.62	SCRIPPS GREEN HOSPITAL
170197	202.18	338.29	KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER LLC
420065	226.78	310.89	BON SECOURS-ST FRANCIS XAVIER HOSPITAL
450822	242.05	383.85	LAS COLINAS MEDICAL CENTER
230072	259.62	431.8	HOLLAND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
100267	269.53	464.71	ENGLEWOOD COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
100252	279.02	536.13	RAULERSON HOSPITAL
450662	282.71	383.66	VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
260006	282.72	361.63	HEARTLAND REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

METHOD:
-------
The hospitals all have different number of measures with related scores.
The range is between 1 and 59. Comparing a hospital with 59 measures to one with 1 
does not make sense. Reducing to just those hospitals with 45 or more measures
results in 2179/4730 hospitals. So we still have a large pool to work with. 

Granted, hospitals being compared will be using different measures. One option is to 
limit the analysis to just certain measures. However, that ended up really limiting the hospitals
I could look at that both had specific measures and had a sufficient number of measures. 
So for the purpose of this assignment, I am not restricting which measures are used,
just the number that are used per hospital.

The hospitals with at least 45 measures are stored in a view Hospital_Prime.

I then ranked the measures, assigning 1 to the best score, and sequential numbers 
to the next best score. This query is a union since the highest score is not always
the best score (time in ER before being admitted after decision to admit, for example. 
Less time in ER would be better than more).
This ranking allows us to now look at all measures as having a rank of the score instead
of the actual score. The range of the ranks is from 1 to 2179 (the number of hospitals).

I then found the mean and standard deviation for each hospital's measure ranks. 
A hospital that is consistent with top scores will have a mean closer to 1 
and a smaller standard deviation. 

Ordering the hospitals by their mean ranks on measures and the standard deviation,
we can determine the top 10 (the hospitals with the highest average ranks).
